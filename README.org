#+TITLE: web-mode-plus â€” a set of additional commands for web-mode
#+LANGUAGE: en

~web-mode-plus~ defines additional commands for ~web-mode~ that weren't merged
to it.

It provides following features:
- following links in HTML files (=C-c C-o= in default bindings)
- creating new tags of the same type like the =M-RET= command in ~org-mode~
  (=M-RET= in default bindings)
- a shortcut to insert a ~<br/>~ tag at point (or on every line in region)
  (=C-c C-RET= in default bindings)

* Installation
This set of extensions depends on [[https://github.com/fxbois/web-mode/][~web-mode~]]. Make sure it's installed and set
up first.

1. Put =web-mode-plus.el= somewhere in your ~load-path~.
2. ~require~ it in your init file

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   (require 'web-mode-plus)
   #+END_SRC
3. Add an ~eval-after-load~ form that sets it up.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (eval-after-load 'web-mode
       (lambda ()
         (web-mode-plus-bind-keys)           ; add default bindings
         (web-mode-plus-set-html-snippets))) ; add a set of better HTML snippets
   #+END_SRC

Autoload comments are added for ~web-mode-plus-bind-keys~ and
~web-mode-plus-set-html-snippets~, so these functions can be used easily with
lazy loading setups.
